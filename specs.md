Of course. Here is a development plan and specifications for your React photo gallery application.

### **Project Development Plan: Photographer's Portfolio**

This plan outlines the necessary steps, architecture, and components to build the application based on your requirements.

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation**

1.  **Tooling & Environment:**
    *   **Project Bootstrapping:** Use Vite to create a new React project for a fast development experience. If you are using Create React App, that is also sufficient.
    *   **Linting & Formatting:** Integrate ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style and quality.
    *   **Styling Solution:** Choose a styling approach. Tailwind CSS is recommended for rapid UI development and utility-first styling, but CSS Modules or Styled-Components are also excellent choices.
    *   **Routing:** Install `react-router-dom` to handle navigation between different views (e.g., the main gallery list and individual galleries).

2.  **Data Handling Strategy:**
    *   Web applications cannot directly access a user's local file system for security reasons. The simplest approach is to place your photo folders inside the `/public` directory of your React project.
    *   **Build-Time Script:** Create a simple Node.js script that runs before the application builds. This script will:
        *   Read the names of all folders within `/public/photos/`.
        *   For each folder, list all the image files inside it.
        *   Generate a `libraries.json` file in the `/public` directory. This JSON file will contain the structure of your libraries and photos, which the React app can then fetch and use.

    **Example `libraries.json` structure:**
    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "Wedding-In-The-Alps",
        "path": "/photos/Wedding-In-The-Alps",
        "photos": [
          "image01.jpg",
          "image02.jpg",
          "image03.jpg"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Portraits-2025",
        "path": "/photos/Portraits-2025",
        "photos": [
          "portrait_a.jpg",
          "portrait_b.jpg"
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

#### **Phase 2: Component Architecture & Development**

The application will be broken down into the following React components:

1.  **`App.jsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** The root component.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Sets up the main application layout.
        *   Configures `react-router-dom` to define the application's routes.

2.  **`LibraryGrid.jsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** The homepage, displaying all available photo libraries.
    *   **Route:** `/`
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Fetches the `libraries.json` data on mount.
        *   Maps over the libraries and renders a thumbnail and title for each one.
        *   Each library thumbnail should link to its specific `LibraryView`.

3.  **`LibraryView.jsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Displays all photos within a single selected library.
    *   **Route:** `/library/:libraryName`
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Gets the `libraryName` from the URL parameters.
        *   Finds the corresponding library data from the fetched `libraries.json`.
        *   Renders all photos from that library as thumbnails in a grid.
        *   (Optional Feature) Include UI controls to switch between different views (e.g., a dense grid, a masonry layout, or a list view).

4.  **`PhotoModal.jsx` or `PhotoView.jsx`**
    *   **Purpose:** Displays a single photo in a full-page or modal overlay.
    *   **Trigger:** Activated when a user clicks on a photo thumbnail in `LibraryView`.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Receives the selected photo's information (e.g., its path) as a prop.
        *   Displays the image prominently, often with a darkened background to focus attention.
        *   Includes a "close" button.
        *   (Optional Feature) Add "next" and "previous" buttons to navigate through the photos in the current library without closing the modal.

#### **Phase 3: Implementation Flow**

1.  **Setup:** Initialize the React project and install dependencies (`react-router-dom`). Set up the chosen styling solution.
2.  **Data Script:** Create the Node.js script to generate `libraries.json`. Add a command to your `package.json` (e.g., `npm run build:data`) to execute it.
3.  **Component Creation:** Develop the components in this order: `LibraryGrid`, then `LibraryView`, and finally `PhotoModal`.
4.  **Routing:** Wire up the routes in `App.jsx` to render the correct components based on the URL.
5.  **State Management:** Use React's built-in state management (useState, useEffect) to fetch and handle the library data. For this scope, a more complex state management library like Redux is not necessary.
6.  **Styling:** Apply styles to all components to create a clean, professional, and responsive user interface.
